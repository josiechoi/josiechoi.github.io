 This past one week was okay at work. I have fixed that scorecard problem and, while I haven't spent much time into fixing the control problem, I added an additional control so that the dashboard would only show data of one fiscal year. Haven't spent much time on R&D this week, as I was spending most of my time coordinating work and pulling data for monthly budget report. However, I mark this as a to-do task to revamp my crkn spreadsheet for next week, to make it easier to other staff to use it.

DC... has redesigned its website. Not loving the new look, but it could be because I am not used to it. I suppose it may be easier on my eyes once I see it often enough. The one advantage with the redesign is that now the ppt of a Python course has fewer green images. In the long run, it probably would save the cost of ink for those for people who buys cartridge and prefers to print in color (I use a monthly plan, so it does not affect me much)

Haven't taken many courses in DC this week. Just completed the course about classes. But because I have completed the software engineering and OOP already, taking this course only consolidated what I learnt before. I don't think I need to print out the ppt for this one, but it was a good experience.

This week, I broke my daily streak and took a break from DC. My longest daily streak right now is three weeks .. Anyways, I took a break for four or five days from DC. I was reading trashy novels to relax a little bit, but did manage to finish ABOK chapter 3. I was having the best kind of reading experience when I was reading ABOK - I was having mental conversation with myself, telling myself which ideas would apply to my workplace, and which ones will not. I was engaged and at times want to grab a pen to drop some ideas down. I definitely need to go back to read this book again, even not for taking aCAP.

With regard to aCAP, still thinking about taking the PREP course, but indeed it will be quite expensive. And if I take it, I probably should also get INFORM membership, which will cost a few more hundred bucks too.

This week, I looked at the Online MBA program from Boston University and was surprised that it does not require GMAT. There is a lot to like about Boston University and how the program is designed - I think it is the perfect fit for someone like me, who is not really considering switching the work field but wants to learn to speak the business language and think like a C-suite leader (that's how you can become the best of the best analyst, to know what your clients would want before they know they want it). Its student population is diverse, its culture collaborative, and its admission process more forgiving for candidates who are not from the homogeneous bourgeois background.  Plus, it's from Boston University, where K. Matthew Dames is the University Librarian. I think of Dr. Dames as some sort of thought leaders, even though I only follow him via Twitter.

However, even though there are a lot to like about BU's MBA program, the price tag is quite high for this one. $24K USD is not a small amount. So I have to think more carefully about it.

Other than BU's program, this week I actually found a few interesting options. MIT has microMaster program about Data, economics, and policy development that is connected to a Master Degree. But to finish the whole thing probably would cost $40K (including $20K for the semester to stay on MIT campus)

Studying... can be such a very expensive pastime. Especially because I do not plan to switch career, I find it hard to justify the cost.

Anyways, today I just enrolled myself to a course about marketing analytics and to the all-too-famous CS 50 in edx. The marketing analytics one is okay. The course does not look hard, but the video is really short (like 15 minutes?), so there may not be much learning there. CS 50, of course, is well-produced. I have just completed an hour-long lecture 0.. It feels almost like it is a theatrical production, with all the pops there. Because it is lecture 0, it mainly is explaining basic concepts in computer science, but I have high hope for this. I should probably have taken this a long time ago, However, only in the recent months, I want to be more serious with OO programming and want to have a solid background in computer science.

I also take a quick look at UofT MI program. Very likely, this is where I want to go next year. The library field is a very unforgiving . To advance , you have to have a MLIS degree. Therefore, I am thinking about finally pursuing one of those. However, I am also entertaining the idea of doing something that is more inspiring and fun, like data science. UofT's program has a concentration for HCDS (human-centered data science), so it can be an interesting option.

Ideally, I want to do something more research-based, so I was also looking about PhD.. Just haven't really figured out how to finance it yet.
