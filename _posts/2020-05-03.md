Happy New Fiscal! ,
Note to self: When building the pipeline to apply algorithms, don't forget to scale 

StandardScaler: documentation from Sklearn https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html

Also, may be a good idea to replace outliers with the threshold

Some random thoughts: 

- Crime Analytics from Chang's could be interesting. Since I would like CODG 102, it's worth considering 

- Journal pricings : boxplot by subject area? maybe to identify journals that are 3 std away from the mean aka outliers? To see what characteristics these would have. The JCR score would probably be high. I wonder if there is a correlation there 

- Probably worth investing time to learn techniques for EDA than to learn dashboard. Dashboard is fun to play with and is flashy. But a lot of the insights come from solid understanding of statistics
