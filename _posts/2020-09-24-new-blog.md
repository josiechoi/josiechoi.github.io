Finished DC's Websscraping course this week and just installed Scrapy to my personal desktop. Took a little longer than expected because of the permission so need to uninstall 3.7 Anaconda and install 3.8. Can't wait to give it a spin. 

DC's course is more about xpath and CSS notation. Scrapy should also work well with Beautiful Soup. Installed last week. 

Excited to see an article in Webscraping in the latest issue of Code4Lib J. When I have the time, definitely need to take a closer look at this. But the author uses Selenium, so that's something I don't have much background knowledge.
