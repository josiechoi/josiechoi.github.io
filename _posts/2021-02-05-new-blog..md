This past one week I learnt an important lesson that I need to jot down: that is, quality insights can come from watching short clips of videos.

When I enrolled into that Market Analysis courses in edx, because the video clips were short, I thought, okay, there would not be so much learning here. But I was wrong. When I watched Lecture 2, which was comprised of three short video clips, it fired up my brain once I started to associate those concepts to my workplace. I smelled that I could write a paper right there if I apply these ideas to higher education/library.

I also watched a few YouTube clips by Economist Terrence Chong. Economics can be applied to anything, so his talks, in spite of the short lengths, were actually quite inspiring.

All these remind me that I should go back to read the papers I collected for MAIS-700. There was something about complexity and the benefit about interdisciplinary studies that are worth revisiting.

I also found this wonderful article from Science magazine. It's about "computational social scientists" and the obstacles and opportunities the field of computational social scientists were facing. Maybe becoming a computational social scientist is what I aspire to be- to bridge arts and sciences. MAIS-700 - and in general the whole MA-IS program - emphasizes on how ideas are generated by crossing disciplinary boundaries, especially when arts marry sciences.

Anyways, this week, I mainly completed the DC course about Twitter and should finish the course about function tonight. The Twitter course touched on graph theory, so it kind of reminded me that Field Institute summer program I went to. I actually applied for accessing the Twitter API recently, but somehow that request fell through the crack ?! I just haven't got my API key...  It would be interesting to apply it on a real set of data.

The DC course about function - super interesting and helpful. I definitely would help me write better code and I now have a stronger understanding of decorators. I actually started a new repo last night, as I feel I should rewrite the whole ezproxy-student from scratch.

Haven't read a chapter of ABOK yet, so I should do it tonight. I do need to go back to take notes for Ch 1 - 3. I also need to work on CS 50.  (Good news is I am taking three days off from work next week, so I can catch up with some learning)

This past one week, I have been a little all over the place. I was reading my stacks of Harvard Business Review too, so that took up some time. I thought I might be able to enhance my business knowledge my reading HBR. It has some interesting research there. And they have recently revamped the app, so it is much user-friendly now.

Just this morning, I started my application for i-school. I have emailed the two professors who have taught me to see if they could be my referee. I also did a quick review with my qualifications. I have a chance, but then there are still so many uncertainties. For instance, my undergraduate performance for my BA was not stellar, even though I did relative well in MA-IS. This year, I am also likely to face fierce competitions, as more recent grads are likely to apply during economic downturns (a fact I learnt from watching Dr. Chong's YouTube channel). Nevertheless, I still want to give this a try. If it does not work out, maybe I will try again next year or I will do something else.

As I prepare my application, I identify some weakness to work on. For instance, I reread a paper I wrote and thought of how I needed to improve my writing skills. When I began MA-IS, one of the comments I got was that, while I had many good ideas and was strong in analysis,  I was prone to make grammatical mistakes. This weakness would hurt my grade. I might have been a little bit better now, but definitely need to more on this further.

It actually may be a good idea to take another course with MA-IS. There were a few courses I was interested in, e.g., the new course about Critical Perspective in Cultural Studies, I would love to take, yet didn't have a chance to take it before I graduate.

It's just that ... it will be another $1,549.
