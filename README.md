###About

Early in my career, I worked in circulation department in a fast-paced public library for 4+ years, followed by 4+ years as a library technician in a high school. Since 2012, I have been working in Ryerson University Library, focusing on serials, acquisition, and electronic resources.

I have developed interests in data analysis. I have completed three career tracks( the Python programmer, Data Analysis with Python, and Data Scientist with Python) via Datacamp. Currently, I am half way through a Data Analytics, Big Data, and Predictive Analysis certificate program at Ryerson University. However, I have put the certificate program on hold so that I can finish my graduate program (MAIS). 

I am a current part-time graduate student at Athabasca University. My focus area for my Masters of Interdisciplinary Studies (MAIS) are Cultural Studies and Educational Studies. I should complete the program at the end of 2018.
